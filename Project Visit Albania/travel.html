          <h2>Breakfast At Marini</h2>
          <img width="1000px" height="600px" src="images/saranda1.jpg" alt="" />
        </div>
       </div>
 <h3> Marini in Saranda is a favorite among locals, expats, and visitors and their breakfast is simply superb. Weather you go for <br>the Albanian
   breakfast (which is a real feast) or any of the western options, like eggs benedict or pancakes, the friendly owners <br>Robert and Gena always make
    sure you start your day happy! Marini is located very centrally, just one street up from the<br> boulevard, so you’re immediately ready to start your day.</h3>

<p>
  <h2>Take A Bus Or Taxi To Butrint</h2>
  <h3>From the restaurant, walk to the southern end of the promenade where you’ll see a bus stop, while taking in some morning <br>sunshine. 
  Take the bus to Butrint (150 lek), which leaves hourly on the half from the port, so it should pass by this bus stop <br>about 5-10 minutes later.
   There is also a taxi stand in case you prefer to take a taxi.</h3>

    <h2>Visit The Archaeological Site Of Butrint</h2>
    <img width="1000px" height="600px" src="images/saranda2.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>
 </div>
<h3>The ancient city of Butrint can’t be missed, even if you’re in Saranda for a day. Butrint was once an important city and it <br> represents the long 
  history of the area, dating back to the ancient Greek tribes, followed by the Romans and Ottomans. The<br> archaeological site is a UNESCO World Hertitage 
  Site and one of the most visited attractions in Albania. The entrance <br> fee is 1000 lek and it takes approximately 2-3 hours to visit the entire site.</h3>

    <h2>Stop For Lunch In Ksamil</h2>
    <img width="1000px" height="600px" src="images/saranda3.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>
 </div>
 <h3>
 Ksamil has some of the best beaches in Albania so we recommend making a stop here for lunch, before heading back to <br>Saranda.
  Guvat serves delicious seafood and they have an amazing patio with a fantastic view over the beach,<br> the turquoise water of the Ionian Sea, 
  and the Ksamil Islands.</h3>
  <div class="bigDiv">
    <div class=" left">
      <h2>Spend Some Time At The Beach</h2>
      <img width="1000px" height="600px" src="images/saranda4.jpg" alt="" />
    </div>
   </div>
   <h3>The Albanian Riviera is famous for its beautiful beaches, so we thought you should spend at least some time at the beach while <br>you’re here. 
   You can either stay the rest of the afternoon in Ksamil or take the bus or a taxi back to Saranda and enjoy some <br>time at one of the many beaches
    around town.</h3>
    <div class="bigDiv">
      <div class=" left">
        <h2>Watch The Sunset From Lekursi Castle
        </h2>
        <img width="1000px" height="600px" src="images/saranda5.jpg" alt="" />
      </div>
     </div>
     <h3>With the coast facing east, the sunsets in Saranda are truly breathtaking, and what better place to enjoy the view than from <br>Lekursi Castle. 
     The 16th century castle is located on the hill behind the town from where you’ll have an amazing view over<br> Saranda and the bay, with Corfu
      on the horizon.We recommend taking a taxi to Lekursi Castle as the road goes all the way <br>around the back of the hill and the climb is quiet steep. 
      If you decide to hike all the way up,this will take you<br> approximately 45 minutes. In that case, we recommend making a short stop for a drink at Natyra. 
      This restaurant is located<br> next to the road up, on the back of the hill and its panorama terrace offer amazing views over the valley and mountain ranges<br>
      on the other side of the town.</h3>

          <h2>Dinner At Haxhi
          </h2>
          <img width="1000px" height="600px" src="images/saranda6.jpg" alt="" />
        </div>
       </div>

      <h3>For dinner we recommend Haxhi, a cosy family-run restaurant, one street up from the promenade, near the entrance of the<br> town. 
      The restaurant doesn’t only look nicely decorated, the food and service 
      are also far beyond the standard in Saranda, <br>while the prices are very reasonable. No wonder the expats are among the frequent visitors here!</h3>

      <div class="bigDiv">
        <div class=" left">
          <h2>Have A Xhiro On The Boulevard
          </h2>
          <img width="1000px" height="600px" src="images/saranda7.jpg" alt="" />
        </div>
       </div>

     <h3>Xhiro literally means ‘walk’ in Albanian and this is a national habit in the evening so you’ll see a lot of people strolling around <br>and socializing.
       After your dinner you might want to take a little walk too and what better place to do this than on the promenade,<br> which really comes to life in
        the evening.</h3>
        <div class="bigDiv">
          <div class=" left">
            <h2>Have The Best Zupa For Dessert
            </h2>
            <img width="1000px" height="680" src="images/saranda8.jpg" alt="" />
          </div>
         </div>

       <h3> Room for desert? Head to Restaurant Paradise at the southern end of the promenade for the best zupa in town. What…a soup<br>
         for desert? Nope, zupa is a delicious desert made of sponge cake, custard and cream, topped with nuts and cocoa. The zupas <br>served at Paradise are handmade in a small family ‘ëmbëltore’ in town, following a generations 
        old recipe.</h3>
        <div class="bigDiv">
          <div class=" left">
            <h2>Have A Cocktail At Jericho
            </h2>
            <img width="1000px" height="600px" src="images/saranda9.jpg" alt="" />

         </div>

         <h3>If you only have 24 hours in Saranda, you really shouldn’t spend the rest of the evening at your hotel. Instead, head over<br>
           to Jericho Cocktail Bar for drink with a view over the promenade and soak up the ambiance. Marina and her team will gladly<br> advise or surprice you with a cocktail 
         to your taste.</h3>
         <br>
         <h2>Dance The Night Away At Orange</h2><h3>Can’t get enough of Saranda’s bustling nightlife? Then continue your night out at Orange Lounge Club and get your feet off the ground 
         until the early hours!</h3>
